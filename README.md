# Physics-and-Mathematics
Some projects inspired by topics from physics and mathematics

This is a repository for all my minor projects undertaken related to the sub domain of physics and mathematics...

#**List of Projects implemented as of yet:**

1.) **Logistic Mapping and Chaos**
The primary objective here is to visually and quantitatively explore the intricate patterns and chaotic regions that arise in the logistic map as we vary a key parameter: r, known as the control parameter. By systematically examining the bifurcation diagram to unveil the population dynamics that occur at different r values. Additionally, the aim is to show the sensitivity of the logistic map to initial conditions by calculating and visualizing Lyapunov exponents.

2.) **Model Fitting on the 4leptons dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meirinevans/4lepton):**
This is a modification of the kaggle notebook provided by CERN which can be found on this link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/meirinevans/model-fitting
The notebook uses ATLAS Open Data http://opendata.atlas.cern to demonstrate how to prepare for fitting a model.
The datasets used in this notebook have already been filtered to include at least 4 leptons per event.

3.) **Ensemble Learning for predicting bandgap of 2D Perovskite data** (work in progress)
